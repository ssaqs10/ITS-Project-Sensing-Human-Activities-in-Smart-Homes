# ITS-Project-Sensing-Human-Activities-in-Smart-Homes

Description	:The project aims to build an AI system which can detect  human activities (e.g., working on computer, walking, eating, sleeping, etc.) in smart homes We will apply advance concepts in machine learning to predict the human activities from accelerometer data. The system will also provide activity suggestions and recommendations for end users (e.g., recommended rest breaks and workstation ergonomics after working for several hours).
